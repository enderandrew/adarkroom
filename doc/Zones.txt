(Tier 4 isn't mean to scale lineraly. It is meant to be exceedingly dangerous and nigh unsurvivable without fabricator upgrades)
(DPS calcs ignore the 0.8 attack chance factor)
(enemy values in parens are actual numbers from encounters)
(Players DPS assumes multiple melee weapons, or unarmed)
(NB: Zones 2 and 3: Mobs do less damage than stated design spec,
but have much more HP as the alternative)
(Player actual HP is higher than original stated docs,
	assumes iron/steel in zones 2/3. NB: Leather in zone 1 is recommended.)
(All figures based on random encounters, not caves/mines/towns/etc)
(Additional note: Bolas reduce enemy DPS to 0. Laser/Riffles increase
	dps significantly at cost of ammo. Player zone 3 base raised from 4 to 6)
(Zone 3 "10" assumes bayonet, and that is NOT always present/not craftable.)
(Sniper WAS significantly weaker than the rest of zone 3. I increase his damage and accuracy.)
(Player DPS will be less; these numbers assume perfect button pressing.)
(If you are going for unarmed combat, you should get 6 dmg in zone 1 --
	that's two boosts up to martial artist. That makes your hth damage 3 and 12
	in zones 2 and 3, matching non-ammo weapons of 3 and 10. No bolas/riffles.)
("barbarian" increases weapon damage 50%, making 4.5, and 9-15, putting HTH
	in second place.)
(A new "increase HTH by 50%/100%" skill level is needed to keep HTH damage in line.
	50% is parity with barbarian and no ammo weapons. 100% is parity with ammo weapons.)
(need to make different enemies feel more unique via venomous, enraged, meditation, stunned, boost, shield, energised, etc)
